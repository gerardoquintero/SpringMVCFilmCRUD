# SpringMVCFilmCRUD

## Overview

This is a full web-based CRUD application that enables users to create, retrieve, update, and delete movie records. The application is built using Spring MVC and implements the DAO pattern for data persistence. The DAO implementation uses JDBC to store and retrieve data from the database. 

Within the app, one of the main features gives the user the ability to search for a film by keyword or a specific pattern within the title. This greatly expands functionality for users that might not know the exact title or ID of the film they are searching for. The app also allows a user to update any film based on it's current details, as well as delete a film from the database if necessary. In its current implementation, the program could be easily modified to expand upon its capabilities.

## Lessons Learned

Through the development of this application, we learned how to use Spring MVC and implement the DAO pattern for data persistence. We also learned how to use JDBC to store and retrieve data from the database. Additionally, we learned how to implement CRUD functionality and enable users to search for records by keyword or pattern.

This project was a great opportunity to improve. Undertaking our first full-stack project was highly beneficial for us several reasons. First, it allows developers to gain experience and proficiency in a variety of technologies and programming languages, ranging from front-end, servers, and back-end. This breadth of knowledge enabled us as developers to take a more holistic approach to problem-solving and develop more comprehensive solutions that address multiple aspects of an application's functionality. Moreover, full-stack projects allow us as developers to gain a deeper understanding of the development process as a whole, from start to server deployment. This project gave us a touch into the real life workflow, as it allows us to demonstrate a range of technical skills that are highly valued in the industry. Therefore, our team undertaking a full-stack project will enhance our employability and career prospects. In conclusion, taking on a full-stack project can be highly advantageous for us as growing developers, providing the cohort with a wide range of technical skills, a deeper understanding of the development process and yet again enhanced career prospects. This reminded me not to ever give in to failure and keep pushing!
