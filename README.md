# SpringMVCFilmCRUD

## Overview

This is a full web-based CRUD application that enables users to create, retrieve, update, and delete movie records. The application is built using Spring MVC and implements the DAO pattern for data persistence. The DAO implementation uses JDBC to store and retrieve data from the database. 

Within the app, one of the main features gives the user the ability to search for a film by keyword or a specific pattern within the title. This greatly expands functionality for users that might not know the exact title or ID of the film they are searching for. The app also allows a user to update any film based on it's current details, as well as delete a film from the database if necessary. In its current implementation, the program could be easily modified to expand upon its capabilities.
